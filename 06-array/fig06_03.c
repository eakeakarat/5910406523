/*
 Notice that the counter-control variable i is declared to be of type `size_t` in each `for` statement (Line 14 and 21),
 which according to the C standard represent an unsigned integral type.
 This type is recommended for any variable that represents an array's size or indices [1]. 

 Type `size_t` is defined in header <stddef.h>, which is often included by other headers (such as <stdio.h>).
 [Note: If you attempt to compile and receive errors, simply include <stddef.h> in your program.]

 [1] On some compilers, `size_t` represents `unsigned int` and on others it represents `unsigned long`.
 Compilers that use `unsigned long` typically generate a warning on line 22 
 because `%u` is for displaying `unsigned int`, not `unsigned long`.
 To eliminate this warning, replace the format specification `%u` with `%lu`
